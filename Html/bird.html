              The toucan is a South American bird in the family Ramphastidae.
              This social bird lives in small flocks in lowland rainforests in
              countries such as Costa Rica. It flies short distances between
              trees. Toucans rest in holes in trees. They mostly eat fruit, but
              sometimes they also eat insects and small lizards. They are
              brightly marked and have large, often-colorful bills. The family

          <div class="hover">
            <p>
              Penguins are seabirds in the family Spheniscidae. They use their
              wings to swim underwater, but they cannot fly in the air. They eat
              fish and other seafood. Penguins lay their eggs and raise their
              babies on land. Penguins live only in the Southern Hemisphere of
              the world: Antarctica, New Zealand, Australia, South Africa and
              South America. The furthest north they get is the Galapagos
              Islands, where the cold Humboldt Current flows past.

          <h6>Parrot</h6>
          <div class="hover">
            <p>
              Parrots are birds of the order Psittaciformes. There are about 372
              species in 86 genera. They are found in most tropical and
              subtropical regions. The greatest diversity of parrots is found in
              South America and Australasia. Parrots are intelligent birds. They
              have relatively large brains, they can learn, and they can use
              simple tools. Because some species have the ability to make sounds
              like human voices and have plumages with bright colors, many
              species are kept as pets. This includes some endangered and
              protected species.
