            <div class="hover">
              <p>
                Turtles are a type of reptile with hard shells on their back.
                There are two types of turtles: side-necked turtles and hidden
                neck turtles. Side-necked turtles have very easy to see necks,
                but hidden neck turtles have very small necks. The order
                Testudines (which includes turtles) includes both living and
                extinct species. The earliest fossil of a turtle was found in
                China from the early Upper Triassic age. The fossil was from
                about 220 million years ago. Turtles are one of the oldest
                reptile groups that are not extinct. Turtles have been on earth
                for longer than lizards, snakes and crocodiles. Turtles are
                related to dinosaurs. Turtles come from ancient turtles, which
                had spiked shells. Turtles are almost everywhere in the world. A
                lot of the turtle species alive today are endangered.

            <p>
              Lizards are reptiles. Together with snakes, they make up the order
              Squamata. There are about 6,000 species,[1] which live all over
              the world, except in cold climates. They range across all
              continents except Antarctica, as well as most oceanic island
              chains.[2] One type, the marine iguana, lives in the sea. Size
              varies greatly, from Geckos of a few inches or cm to the Komodo
              dragon of 3 meters (9 feet) and 70 kg (150 pounds).

          <h6>Snake</h6>
          <div class="hover">
            <p>
              Snakes are reptiles. They are part of the order Squamata. They are
              carnivores, with long narrow bodies and no legs. There are at
              least 20 families, about 500 genera and 3,400 species of snake.
              The earliest known fossils are from the Jurassic period. This was
              between 143 and 167 million years ago. Their long, slender body
              has some special features. They have overlapping scales which
              protect them, and help them move and climb trees. The scales have
              colours which may be camouflage or warning colours.

          <h6>Crocodile</h6>
          <div class="hover">
            <p>
              A crocodile is a large amphibious reptile. It lives mostly in
              large tropical rivers, where it is an ambush predator. One
              species, the Australian saltie, also travels in coastal salt
              water. In very dry climates, crocodiles may aestivate and sleep
              out the dry season. The modern type of crocodile appeared first in
              the Eocene period. Its ancestors go much further back to the Upper
              Triassic. The name "crocodile" is also used for any member of the
              order Crocodilia. They are basically Archosaurs, a group which
              also includes the dinosaurs. There are many species of crocodiles
              including the American, slender-snouted and Orinoco crocodile. The
              crocodile can quickly snap its jaw shut with much power. However,
              crocodiles have little strength when opening their jaws, such that
              a person can hold the jaw shut with their hands. Crocodiles range
              in size from African dwarf crocodiles that measure rarely over 5
              feet (1.5 m) to saltwater crocodiles which can approach 23 feet (7
              m).

          <h6>Chameleon</h6>
          <div class="hover">
            <p>
              Chameleons are a family of lizards. Most can change the color of
              their skins for camouflage, or to signal mood to other chameleons.
              They are a distinct clade of lizards. There are about 160 species,
              living in Africa, Madagascar, Spain and Portugal, and across south
              Asia. They have been introduced to Hawaii, California and Florida,
              and are found in warm habitats that vary from rain forest to
              desert conditions. Chameleons are often kept as household pets.
              They have parrot-like zygodactylous feet, separately mobile and
              stereoscopic eyes, very long tongues they can flick out, a swaying
              gait, their prehensile tail, crests or horns on their
              strange-shaped heads, and many can change color. Chameleons have
              long sticky tongues that they can fire out a fraction of a second.
              They stretch up to twice their body size. The largest species is
              about 1.5 feet when fully grown. They are mainly insectivores, but
              larger species may take occasional smaller lizards and young
              birds.

          <h6>Tuatara</h6>
          <div class="hover">
            <p>
              The Tuatara are reptiles which look like lizards. However, they
              are the only surviving member of an order of reptiles which
              flourished 200 million years ago. There is now only the genus
              Sphenodon, with two species of Tuatara. Both are endemic to (only
              live in) New Zealand. Lizards and snakes are the closest living
              relatives of the tuatara. Tuatara are green-brown, and measure up
              to 80 cm from head to the end of their tail.[1] They have a spiny
              crest along the back: the Maori word tuatara refers to this.[2]
              The crest is more pronounced in males. Tuatara are special in many
              ways. One of these is the pattern of their teeth. They have two
              rows of teeth in the upper jaw overlap one row on the lower jaw.
              This is unique among living species.
