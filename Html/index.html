              <p>
                The cat (Felis catus) is a domestic species of small carnivorous
                mammal. It is the only domesticated species in the family
                Felidae and is sometimes referred to as the domestic cat or
                house cat to distinguish it from the wild members of the family.
                A cat can either be a house cat, a farm cat, or a feral cat; the
                latter ranges freely and avoids human contact. Domestic cats are
                valued by humans for companionship and their ability to kill
                rodents. About 60 cat breeds are recognized by various cat
                registries.

          <h6>Dogs</h6>
          <div class="hover">
            <p>
              The dog or domestic dog (Canis familiaris or Canis lupus
              familiaris) is a domesticated descendant of the wolf. The dog is
              derived from an ancient, extinct wolf, and the modern wolf is the
              dog's nearest living relative. The dog was the first species to be
              domesticated, by hunter-gatherers over 15,000 years ago, before
              the development of agriculture. Due to their long association with
              humans, dogs have expanded to a large number of domestic
              individuals and gained the ability to thrive on a starch-rich diet
              that would be inadequate for other canids.

          <h6>Platypus</h6>
          <div class="hover">
            <p>
              The platypus (Ornithorhynchus anatinus), sometimes referred to as
              the duck-billed platypus, is a semiaquatic, egg-laying mammal
              endemic to eastern Australia, including Tasmania. The platypus is
              the sole living representative or monotypic taxon of its family
              (Ornithorhynchidae) and genus (Ornithorhynchus), though a number
              of related species appear in the fossil record.

          <h6>Kangaroo</h6>
          <div class="hover">
            <p>
              The kangaroo is a marsupial from the family Macropodidae
              (macropods, meaning "large foot"). In common use the term is used
              to describe the largest species from this family, the red
              kangaroo, as well as the antilopine kangaroo, eastern grey
              kangaroo, and western grey kangaroo. Kangaroos are indigenous to
              Australia and New Guinea. The Australian government estimates that
              42.8 million kangaroos lived within the commercial harvest areas
              of Australia in 2019, down from 53.2 million in 2013.

          <h6>Gerbil</h6>
          <div class="hover">
            <p>
              Gerbils are a family of rodents. There are about 110 species of
              gerbils. All gerbils are adapted to arid habitats. At one time,
              gerbils were known as wild rats. Most gerbils are diurnal, some
              are crepuscular. The gerbil is native to Central Asia, India, the
              Middle East, and Africa. The average length of a gerbil is usually
              between six and twelve inches, this includes the tail which makes
              up one half of the total length. The gerbil is also a common
              household pet.

          <h6>Weasel</h6>
          <div class="hover">
            <p>
              Weasels are the genus Mustela, part of the Mustelidae family. The
              genus includes the weasels, polecats, stoats, ferrets and minks.
              Weasels are small, active predators, long and slender with short
              legs. Their body shape is adapted to going down burrows after prey
              such as rabbits. There are 17 species, and they live all over the
              world except for Antarctica and Australasia.
